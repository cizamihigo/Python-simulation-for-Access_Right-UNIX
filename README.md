# Python-simulation-for-Access_Right-UNIX

Have you ever used the Unix CHMOD command?
  	If yes you probably know what permissions are. we will come back to the permissions and access right later.
# What is the purpose of this application?
	> first of all this application is a simulation of Unix Permission in Python
	> the purpose is to know how the computer is changing the permission from its text form to its numerical form or numerical to text form
	
  That way the programmer will understand why the user is required to write in one way or another because the computer is going to interpret it in the way it have been submitted.
  
  . Anyone can copy the code, reuse it or even implement it so it can be perfect and i hope you will !!!
 # Access rights on files.
•	r (or -), indicates read permission (or otherwise), that is, the presence or absence of permission to read and copy the file 
•	w (or -), indicates write permission (or otherwise), that is, the permission (or otherwise) to change a file 
•	x (or -), indicates execution permission (or otherwise), that is, the permission to execute a file, where appropriate 

 
 # Changing access rights in Unix the command is:
	chmod (changing a file mode)
  Only the owner of a file can use chmod to change the permissions of a file. The options of chmod are as follows
